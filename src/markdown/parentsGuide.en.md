### Parent's Guide

In an effort to offer parents the best available information on safety in games, we have partnered with Internet Matters. Go visit our partner page for a vast selection of informative resources on anything related to online safety. Since you’re here, most likely you, or someone you care about, have picked up one of our games in the name of fun. Thank you! We hope you enjoy them as much as we do making them.

To make sure you can enjoy Mooxer Games in a safe and controlled environment, we stick to a clear set of principles that’ve served our gamers and us well:

- We respect our gamers, and we put all our might into making the most fun games for them to enjoy. We’ll never sacrifice game quality for any other short-term considerations.

- We want you to be in total control of your experience with Mooxer Games games. That means that before you or your child download our games, you should be given upfront information about the game’s content. This means that it should be totally clear when you’re about to make any purchases within a game.

- If you or your child ever has any problems with our games, you should be able to quickly find out how to fix it. As well as providing guides like this, that means helping you to contact the right company for your issue, whether it’s to do with payments (which will usually be Google or Apple, who process purchases and refunds) or the game itself (which will usually be us).

Read on as we try to cover what might be your most likely questions. If we’ve missed anything, email us at [parents@mooxergames.com](mailto:parents@mooxergames.com) In your email, be sure to include any specific details that might be useful, like what happened and when, possible transaction ID receipts, relevant screenshots, etc.

#### WHAT ARE THE AGE LIMITS FOR MOOXER GAMES?

Our games do not have general age limits. However, users of our games should observe that, under our Terms of Service, users under the legal age of majority in the country of their residence require their legal guardian’s approval of our Terms of Service before registering their account.

Please note: When you download our games from e.g. Google Play or Apple's App Store you will find published age recommendations in the apps description. However, these age or maturity classifications refer only to the content suitability (similar to movie ratings G, PG or PG-13 in the U.S., but related to gameplay, animations, etc.) according to the respective rating body responsible for such ratings. As these ratings are done independently by a third party without our contribution, they are not necessarily in line with our Terms of Service.

For more info on how these categories are defined, visit these support websites for  [Apple](https://itunes.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/appRatings?ratingSystem=appsApple) and [Google](https://support.google.com/googleplay/answer/1075738?hl=en)

#### CAN I MANAGE OR TURN OFF IN-APP PURCHASES?

All our apps are available for free download. Please note, however, that our games also offer fully optional "in-app purchases". These purchases are not strictly required in the game, but can be used to enhance certain elements of the game. For example, the cost of in-app purchases varies in the US app stores and ranges from $0.99 to $99.99 (tax not included).

In-app purchases are made with real money and this is always clearly stated. Purchases can be accessed "in-game", i.e. the purchase option is available within the game.

**Important:** You can easily manage the options to make in-app purchases, edit password protection settings and disable in-app purchases in the general settings of your mobile device. How you do this varies for Apple iOS devices, such as iPhone or iPad, or Google Android devices. In each case, here are the instructions you'll need:

[Instructions for Google Android devices (like Samsung Galaxy, OnePlus, HTC, Nexus, etc)](https://support.google.com/googleplay/answer/1626831?hl=tr)

#### WHO PROCESSES IN-APP PURCHASES?

Mooxer Games does not process payments for in-app purchases, or have access to credit card information. Payment transactions themselves are processed through the App Store or Google Play (depending on your device) via the personal email address associated with that account. Transaction receipts are emailed to you by Apple or Google after each purchase. Sometimes, purchases may be bundled together if you've bought multiple items, and it might take a few days for you to receive the receipt. These post-purchase processes are subject to change by Apple or Google. Mooxer Games doesn't offer any billing programs.

#### I’VE SEEN ANOTHER SITE THAT OFFERS IN-GAME PRODUCTS FOR MOOXER GAMES. CAN I BUY FROM THEM?

If you want to make an in-app purchase, the only way is to buy through the game itself on your mobile device. Beware of any third party sites that promise you enhancements for our games (like “free gem” websites, etc). These sites may collect your personal information, money, or both, and often never deliver the promised in-game products. Selling, redeeming or trading virtual in-game currency is otherwise not allowed by our [Terms of Service](termsOfService).

#### MY CHILD ACCIDENTALLY MADE AN IN-APP PURCHASE. CAN I GET A REFUND?

As with most downloadable software products, there are no refunds for items purchased in our games (in-app purchases). Exceptions may be made in rare cases.

**If the purchase was made on an Apple (iOS) device:**
For purchases made on iOS devices, Mooxer Games cannot handle refunds directly. Please visit  [Apple support](https://support.apple.com/itunes) and select the "Contact iTunes store support" link, then the "Account and Billing" link to find the best option for you.

**If the purchase was made on a Google (Android) device:**
Please send an email to  [parents@mooxergames.com](mailto:parents@mooxergames.com) or contact us directly by tapping "Contact Us" in the top right corner. In your message, please indicate the name of the game where the purchase was made and attach the invoice for the transaction. The Transaction ID (in the format GPA.1234-1234-1234-12345) should be visible at the bottom of the document. Google will email you an invoice after each transaction.

#### I’VE RECEIVED A BILL FOR A PURCHASE I DIDN’T MAKE. WHAT SHOULD I DO IF I SUSPECT FRAUDULENT ACTIVITY?

If you or your child has not played one of our games and you believe that fraudulent activity has taken place on your account, you should immediately contact Apple (for iOS devices) or Google (for Android devices), who are managing the activity.

**For Apple (iOS) devices:**
 Visit [Apple support](https://support.apple.com/itunes)  and select the "Contact iTunes store support" link, then "Purchases, billing and redemption" and choose the option that fits you best.

**For Google (Android) devices:**
Visit [Google support](https://support.google.com/googleplay/?hl=en#topic=3364260)  and make a call or use the "Contact Us" button on the page to reach a Google customer support representative via email or phone.

If you have contacted Apple or Google about the fraudulent transaction and they have referred you to us, please contact us at [parents@mooxergames.com](mailto:parents@mooxergames.com) Be sure to include detailed information including what happened and when, transaction invoices, relevant screenshots, etc.


#### WHAT IS MOOXER GAMES PRIVACY POLICY?

Your privacy is our top priority. At Mooxer Games, we do not have access to any of your credit card information. This is because your payments are processed through the Apple App Store or Google Play (depending on your device) via your personal email address associated with your account. We always ask for your consent before sending direct marketing messages to your mobile phone.

We do not sell or give your personal data to third parties to use for advertising purposes. We always ask for your consent before sending direct marketing messages to your mobile phone.
