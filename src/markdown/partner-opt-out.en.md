### OPTING OUT OF BEHAVIOURALLY TARGETED ADVERTISING AND ANALYTICS

If you wish to limit behaviourally targeted advertising, you can do so by limiting ad tracking in your device settings. Please note that opt-outs are specific to each browser and device and it may take a little bit of time before your opt-out will take effect.

For mobile advertising in apps, you can reset your Advertising Identifier and depending on your device, select to opt out of interest-based ads (Android) or turn on the Limit Ad Tracking setting (iOS).

For display advertising on the Web, you can also adjust your browser settings to limit certain tracking by means of cookies, and by visiting the following sites:[aboutads.info/choices](http://www.aboutads.info/choices) and [youronlinechoices.eu/](http://www.youronlinechoices.eu/)

Mooxer Games also works with a number of other analytics and ad serving partners within our mobile apps, websites and elsewhere online. These partners can use cookies, web beacons, and other tracking technologies to collect or receive data about you and might claim controller rights over your personal data.
